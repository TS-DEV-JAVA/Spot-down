### Spot-down, how it works
Spot-down takes a spotify URL or search, makes it a youtube music link, then downloads it with yt-dlp, (streaming is still beta, it useses youtube, but the download still uses youtube music)
Spot-down is currenly V1, stay tuned for more and more updates, i dont plan on abandoning this project ANY time soon !!

## Spot-down Pros
- Not a skid of SpotDL
- Not a copy of it eaither
- can download at 1300kb bitrate, flac, etc.
- Can strean at very high quilty (built in player for streaming and playing music you already downloaded)
- Clean TUI with rich
- Very fast when downloading (unlike spotdl because its always rate limited)
- You can EASILY change the spotify client id and secret
- Supports high qulity meta data including cover art, tho not avalible for some formats like wav and opus
- Easy to use, no cli just TUI, cli is the backend
- Built in audio compressor (optional to use)

## Spot-down Cons:
- I HAD To obufscate it so github wont ban me for "sharing secret keys" such as spotify client id and secret, how ever scripts that dont use spotify client id and  secret WILL NOT BE OBFUSCATED !
- Streaming is bugy, but works  (i am working on a fix)
