## Demo:

### Spot-down, how it works
Spot-down takes a spotify URL or search, makes it a youtube music link, then downloads it with yt-dlp, (streaming is still beta, it useses youtube, but the download still uses youtube music)
Spot-down is currenly V1, stay tuned for more and more updates, i dont plan on abandoning this project ANY time soon !!

## Spot-down Features
- Not a skid of SpotDL
- Not a copy of it eaither
- can download at 1300kb bitrate, flac, etc.
- Can strean at very high quilty (built in player for streaming and playing music you already downloaded)
- Clean TUI with rich
- Very fast when downloading (unlike spotdl because its always rate limited)
- You can EASILY change the spotify client id and secret
- Supports high qulity meta data including cover art, tho not avalible for some formats like wav and opus
- Easy to use, no cli just TUI, cli is the backend
- open src, anyone can do anything they want with it, but stay on license
- Built in audio compressor (optional to use)
